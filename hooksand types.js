Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. 

Types of Hooks: 
1. useState: This is the most basic hook that lets you add state to a functional component. 
2. useEffect: This hook lets you perform side effects in function components. 
3. useContext: This hook lets you access the React context in a functional component. 
4. useReducer: This hook is used for state management in a functional component. 
5. useCallback: This hook is used to memoize functions in a component so that it only re-renders when necessary. 
6. useMemo: This hook is used to create and cache values for performance optimization in a component. 
7. useRef: This hook is used to access DOM elements or React elements created with createRef().
