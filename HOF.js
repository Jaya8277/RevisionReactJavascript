HOF stands for Higher Order Functions, which are functions that take other functions
 as arguments and/or return a function as a result. In React, HOFs are used to create
  reusable components and logic that can be shared across different parts of an application. 
  Examples of HOFs in React include map(), reduce(), filter(), and compose().
