React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for
 building user interfaces. It is used for creating reusable UI components that can be used in both
  web and mobile applications. React allows developers to create large web applications that use data
   and can change over time without reloading the page. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity, 
   and scalability. React also allows developers to create components, manage state, and compose them in 
   complex UIs. React makes it easier to create interactive UIs by breaking down the UI into components that
    can be reused across different parts of the application.
